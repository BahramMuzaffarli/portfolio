# Creative Portfolio (static scaffold)

This is a simple static portfolio scaffold created for quick customization. Replace the text, images, and styles with your own content.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — styles
- `js/script.js` — small interactive scripts

How to run locally:

1. Open the folder in your editor and open `index.html` in your browser. OR
2. Run a quick static server (Python):

```powershell
# from project root
python -m http.server 8000; Start-Process http://localhost:8000
```

Next steps:
- Replace placeholder images with your own images in an `assets/` folder.
- Update copy, colors, and add case-study pages if desired.
